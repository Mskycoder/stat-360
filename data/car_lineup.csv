"We dream in black and white checkered flags.

Right from the start, the Mercedes-Benz brand has stood for sporting success as well as comfort and luxury. On the road, and on the racetrack, cars bearing the famous three-pointed star have put their performance to the test time and time again. 

In 1900 we delivered the first ever vehicle to bear the name “Mercedes”. It was the first modern motorcar, boasted 35 hp and was, in fact, a racecar. In 1952 the 300 SL, the legendary gullwing model, first saw the light of day – and the checkered flags – at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Bern Grand Prix and the Carrera Panamericana.

In 1967 two former Mercedes engineers founded AMG with a simple goal – to design and produce the world’s best racing engines. 

In 1971, just four years after launching their dream, the legendary “Red Sow”, a bright-red 300 SEL 6.8 AMG, sped over the finish line, and into the history books, as the champion of its class at the 24 Hours of Spa. Countless victories in many racing series followed – establishing AMG as a force in the racing world.

Now, the engineers at Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Benz have joined to develop a sports car for modern times. They chase the dream with the same passion as their predecessors but use technology of the future. 

The SLS AMG pushes the limits of design and engineering. Mission accomplished. A new legend has been born.
